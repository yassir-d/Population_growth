# AI Tool Usage Disclosure (AI_USAGE.md)

## Tools Used
- ChatGP and Claude: debugging help, code structure suggestions, and documentation assistance.

## How AI Was Used
I used AI as a collaborator to:
- Debug Python errors (imports, function signatures, path handling, pandas parsing issues).
- Propose a clean project structure and module separation.
- Help draft documentation text (README/PROPOSAL/report outline).

## Significant Contributions (where AI meaningfully helped)
  **Data ingestion & parsing**
   - Guidance on loading PC-Axis `.px` files and handling multilingual PX structures.
   - Robust path handling with `pathlib`.

## What I Did Myself
- Implemented and integrated the final code in my repository.
- Chose the dataset files and organized the data folders.
- Ran experiments, produced figures/tables, and verified outputs.
- Fixed remaining bugs and ensured `python main.py` runs end-to-end.

## Understanding & Academic Integrity
I understand the code I submitted and can explain the design decisions, model assumptions, and evaluation methodology.
