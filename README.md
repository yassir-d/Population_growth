## Swiss Population Forecasting — Model Comparison Project

Forecasting Switzerland’s population using statistical models and machine learning
 Advanced Programming — Fall 2025 (HEC Lausanne)

## Project Overview

This project develops a data-driven population forecasting system for Switzerland using publicly available demographic data.
The main goal is to evaluate whether machine learning models can outperform a naïve baseline forecast (constant percentage growth).

The project includes:

Data processing from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (BFS)

**Forecasting models :**

Naïve baseline model (constant growth rate)

Linear Regression

Autoregressive model (AR / simplified ARIMA)

Random Forest Regression

Formal model comparison using:

RMSE

MAE

MAPE

Visualization of forecasts and errors

Clean modular code following course requirements

**Why This Project ?**

Population forecasting is crucial for :

housing planning

public infrastructure

pension system projections

labor market policies

This project demonstrates:

real-world data handling

machine learning application

model validation

reproducible research
